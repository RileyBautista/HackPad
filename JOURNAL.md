# Have an oh crap moment, add a rotary encoder, and complete firmware
Take a hiatus wondering if I should submit it then proceed to procrastinate until 2 days before leaving for Undercity

Added rotary encoder, studied how other projects implemented the rotary encoder and learned how the heck KMK used it and turned it into a rudimentary volume knob,
Additionally created a macro to reset in roblox because why not and a key that automatically opens https://youareanidiot.cc
